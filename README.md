## What is Life?
~~42. No, wait, that's the *meaning* of life.~~ [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) simulates cells that live or die according to four simple rules:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
These simple rules can create complex patterns as each generation progresses. "Live" cells are represented by black pixels, which turn white when they "die."
## How to play
1. Either choose a pattern (glider, glider gun, or random) with the Choose a Pattern button or draw cells directly onto the grid.
2. Press Start to start generating new generations.
3. Press Pause to pause.
4. Press Clear to clear the grid.
## Setup
1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
3. Start IDLE.
4. Open view.py (File > Open or Ctrl+O).
5. Run module (Run > Run Module or F5).
